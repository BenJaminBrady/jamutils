.SH NAME
reboot - hard reset the system if possible
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B reboot
.SH DESCRIPTION
Reboot the system if possible (the caller must have sufficient privileges in
the form of having CAP_SYS_BOOT inside their user namespace).

This is a Linux-specific system call and thus is only guaranteed
to work if Linux is the currently running kernel.
